# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction using Classification

Customer attrition, often referred to as customer churn or turnover, is a critical concern for businesses as it represents the percentage of customers who have stopped using their products or services within a specific timeframe. Accurately identifying why and when customers leave can significantly impact an organization's strategy for customer retention.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict customer churn and understand the key indicators of churn by analyzing a dataset containing various customer attributes. By employing machine learning techniques, we'll determine the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization and explore effective retention strategies to mitigate this challenge.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises the following columns:

Gender: Male or female classification of the customer.

SeniorCitizen: Binary indicator of whether the customer is a senior citizen.

Partner: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes/No).

Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes/No).

Tenure: Duration in months the customer has stayed with the company.

Phone Service: Availability of phone service for the customer (Yes/No).

MultipleLines: Presence of multiple phone lines for the customer (Yes/No).

InternetService: Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber Optic, No internet service).

OnlineSecurity: Availability of online security (Yes/No/No internet service).

OnlineBackup: Availability of online backup (Yes/No/No internet service).

DeviceProtection: Availability of device protection (Yes/No/No internet service).

TechSupport: Availability of tech support (Yes/No/No internet service).

StreamingTV: Availability of streaming TV (Yes/No/No internet service).

StreamingMovies: Availability of streaming movies (Yes/No/No internet service).

Contract: Customer's contract term (Month-to-Month, One year, Two years).

PaperlessBilling: Usage of paperless billing (Yes/No).

Payment Method: Customer's payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), 
Credit card (automatic)).
MonthlyCharges: Monthly charges for the customer.

TotalCharges: Total charges incurred by the customer.

Churn: Whether the customer churned (Yes) or not (No).
